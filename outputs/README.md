# Outputs Folder Guide

This folder contains everything produced by the pipeline for **viewing and sharing**.

## Start here (non‑technical)

- Open `TEAM_PORTAL.html` in the project root to browse dashboards, maps, and key tables.

## Subfolders

- `exports/` — CSV/JSON exports and browser‑openable HTML maps (some are very large).
- `model_ready/` — tidy CSV panels for statistical modeling/EDA (shareable).
- `reports/` — short HTML reports for specific questions/deliverables.
- `visualizations/` — dashboards, Sankey images/PDFs, and visualization utilities.

## Tips

- If an HTML map is slow to open, try Chrome and close other tabs.
- CSVs are designed to open in Excel/Google Sheets.
