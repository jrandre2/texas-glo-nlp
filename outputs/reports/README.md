# Reports (HTML)

This folder contains short, shareable **HTML reports** that answer specific project questions in a non-technical way.

## How to use

- Open any `.html` file in your browser (Chrome recommended).
- If a report references images, keep the `assets/` folder in the same directory.

## Current reports

- `harvey_action_plan_fund_switch_report.html` — extracted snippets about moving/reallocating funds
- `harvey_housing_zip_progress_report.html` — housing program progression over quarters with ZIP-level summaries

Most people should start from `TEAM_PORTAL.html` in the project root, which links to these reports and key tables.
